### A client-server architecture based on Node.js to display daily weather forecasts.

OpenWeatherMap (http://openweathermap.org/) is a service which provides open weather data for any location on Earth,  available via a web-site and through an API. It provides a wide range of
weather data including current weather, forecast, precipitations, wind, clouds, data from weather stations, maps, analytics, etc. It also provides historical weather data.
Through its API (http://openweathermap.org/api) you can request JSON, XML or HTMLdata.  You will need to create a free account to receive an API key (see http://openweathermap.org/appid).
